# Clear Speech

## Introduction

It is the course project for Explainable AI design at JHU. It focuses on building a subtitle-generating system that achieves better results than both humans and AI through human-AI teaming. 

This tool transcribes speech to text and flags uncertain parts for human review to ensure higher accuracy than either alone for journalists, students, researchers, and professionals who need accurate transcriptions of interviews, lectures, or meetings.

The hardcore prototype for this solution is in this repository.
